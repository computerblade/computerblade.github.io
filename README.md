Redirection of AyProductions' old website. I have changed my username anyway.

I make projects as a hobby. One of my most favourite projects is, Python IDE. It's not an IDE, but it might be soon! It's currently a code editor. Also, I make tutorials and publish it here. I made one more hobby project as well, and it was a racing game. I completely scrapped it off. I moderate at Rapid Community and am a regular (not anymore because I wasn't really active for a month or two) at MIT App Inventor Community.
