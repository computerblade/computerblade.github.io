Why I got banned in the forums of Kodular?



A: TL;DR: I only told them to add an option back and they banned me.

Yeah so, you have indeed seen an account on their forums @MosEngWeb. And that account hasn't been posting since December 27th of 2021. I owned that account.

It was just a growing account with good intentions. I joined the forums because I just got into Kodular and stuff. I asked for help. They helped me. I complemented each and every tutorial and extension I could find! Everybody liked my posts! I even praised Kodular once! Even that was liked by bunch of Moderators but Peter, who plays a key role here.

Peter is also a moderator. He is honestly one of the worst people I have ever come across in my life!

Maybe he complemented me once! But guess what happened most of the time? He never even bothered to help me! According to all of my experiences there, Kodular is an extremely bad place. They will ban you if you rectify their mistakes. Rectlfying a mistake is doing bad? No. So why will they ban me?


It was the day after Christmas. I was checking Kodular Updates until I stumbled upon forum UI changes. They said they'll add an option for switching to the old style about a month ago or so. The topic was still active though! I said there that when will they add the option because they still haven't added! If you really think I have done bad, why not flag the post? They banned me for that, both IP and account banned!


So moral of the story, never ever use Kodular, that is the biggest mistake you'll ever do because they will ban you basically even if you do a little issue that can be fixed within no time.

Also the same thing applied to MinecraftOnline, the oldest survival server of Minecraft! One of the former admins (the owner banned him as well) said that good people go to waste.

Peter, if you're reading this, do a better job and unban me, even better, don't be a mod, be a regular instead! or else Sky knows what will happen to you.
